# Real-Time-Vehicle-Tracking-and-Counting-YOLO11-
A real-time Vehicle Tracking &amp; Counting pipeline using YOLO11, OpenCV, and Python.     It detects and tracks multiple vehicle classes with unique IDs, draws bounding boxes, labels, and centroids,     and counts vehicles reliably when they cross a virtual line.     Finally, the workflow practical for traffic monitoring and analytics.
